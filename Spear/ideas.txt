Platformer based around using a spear to move around.

If caught in midair, the spear will add it's momentum to the players (Along with a little extra height)(Theo rock - Celeste)
The spear can stick in walls and be jumped off of, but it will fall to the ground afterwards.
The spear can be called back to the player, flying towards the player and gaining speed over time. It doesn't travel through walls when doing this.
The spear can be summoned to the player, teleporting it to the player with no momentum transfer.

The player gets a single wall kick after landing on the ground.
The wall kick grants significant height and a little bit of forward momentum.

The player can grab ledges and pull themself up on top of them.

There can be multiple spears in a stage, but the player can only call or summon a single one of them.

You can't call/summon your spear until after beating the tutorial.




Jumping off of a spear stuck in the wall, wall kicking, and calling the spear up to you can be used to gain great amounts of height.
